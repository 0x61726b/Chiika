# Streaming on Chiika

Detecting stream media is one of the major goals of Chiika. In order to make the process smooth, we implemented several different methods, depending on which platform you are running Chiika. See platform sections.

Currently Chiika supports following services. If you are on Linux, you will have to install our [firefox](firefox) or [chrome](https://github.com/arkenthera/chiika-chrome/raw/master/chiika-chrome.crx) extension for streaming detection to work.
They are not signed extensions yet, because I can't pay for the developer registration fee now.

## Windows

Streaming on Windows is supported natively, so you don't have to anything extra.

## OSX

Streaming on OSX will be supported natively (soon). Otherwise install the extensions.

## Linux

Due to limited native API and number of different desktop systems (Gnome,KDE,Unity etc.)
Chiika doesn't support streaming detection natively, but via extensions. Install chiika-firefox or chiika-chrome to make Chiika capable of stream detection.
